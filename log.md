# 100 Days Of Code - Log

<h2>100 Days of Code - Log </h2>

Day 19: December 7, 2018

<b>Today's Progress:</b>  Purchased a new Udemy course, "The Modern JavaScript Bootcamp‚Äù on November 19, 2018.  Since then, I have been spending about an hour a day going through the course, since then.  I have been working on the #100DaysofCoding since then, butdid not read the directions and post logs here.  This is my first log to encompass my past 19 days.
Currently, I am on Lecture 88 of the course.  Taught myself how to use and set up a git hub respository and to upload current lessons worked on from tutorial

<b>Thoughts:</b>  Course seems pretty easy to follow.   Enjoying the challenges included.

Day 20: December 8, 2018

<b>Today's Progress:</b>  Continued to work on Udemy Javascript course.   I completed Lectures 88 - 92, whose topics were on Object Oriented programming in Javascript.  Also began to create a Javascript hangman app for the course, while implementing what was learned in the lectures.  

<b>Thoughts:</b>  Need to watch for typos when doing the code.  I found myself getting frustrated with errors coming up, and they be nothing more than typos.

Day 22: December 10, 2018

<b>Today's Progress:</b> I took yesterday off from coding.  Made up for it today by going through 4 lectures today.  The lectures entailed protypical inheritence, primitive objects, and completing more of the hangman game app.  

<b>Thoughts:</b> Those typos will totally screw you up if you do not catch them.  lol

Day 23: December 11, 2018

<b>Today's Progress:</b>  I was only able to work on Lecture 96 today because it was mostly a challenge that took up most of my hour.  With this challenge, I worked on it without looking at previous examples for most of the coding.  The challenge was to add more functionality to hangman game app.  

<b>Thoughts:</b>  There are many ways to solve a task.  My solution was not mentioned in his tutorial, but it was still a working one.

Day 24: December 12, 2018

<b>Today's Progress:</b>  Completed lectures 99 - 101.  Continued to update hangman app using new learned topics classes, sub classes, and getter/setters.  

<b>Thoughts:</b>  Classes make the code more readable.

Day 25: December 13, 2018

<b>Today's Progress:</b>  I had extra free time at work, so I was able to get through quite a number of lectures.  Completed lectures 102 thru 112.  started learning asynchronous javascript concepts, such as http requests, callbacks and promises.  

<b>Thoughts:</b>  it was interesting to see how website access occurs "behind the scenes".

Day 26: December 14, 2018

<b>Today's Progress:</b> My Fridays are normally PC maintenance days for me.  While doing maintenance, I decided to take a break from the class and do a project on my own.  I tried to create a battleship game app.  I had done it in a python course through Codeacademy.  So I thought I would try and convert it to Javascript.   I got pretty far. I got the board to print out but still have to work on the logic of the game.  

<b>Thoughts: </b>  MDN has a good resourse base for looking up javascript helps.
