# 100 Days Of Code - Log

<h2>100 Days of Code - Log </h2>

Day 19: December 7, 2018

<b>Today's Progress:</b>  Purchased a new Udemy course, "The Modern JavaScript Bootcamp‚Äù on November 19, 2018.  Since then, I have been spending about an hour a day going through the course, since then.  I have been working on the #100DaysofCoding since then, butdid not read the directions and post logs here.  This is my first log to encompass my past 19 days.
Currently, I am on Lecture 88 of the course.  Taught myself how to use and set up a git hub respository and to upload current lessons worked on from tutorial

<b>Thoughts:</b>  Course seems pretty easy to follow.   Enjoying the challenges included.
